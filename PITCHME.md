### Why Xamarin?

---

### Using Xamarin

---

# Cross-Platform .NET

---

### Shared Asset Projects

---

### PCLs

---

### .NET Standard
* Defines uniform set of Base Class Library (BCL) APIs for all .NET platforms to implement, independent of workload.
* Enables developers to produce portable libraries that are usable across .NET runtimes, using this same set of APIs.
* Reduces and hopefully eliminates conditional compilation of shared source due to .NET APIs, only for OS APIs.

---

### IDEs
* Visual Studio
* Xamarin Studio
* Visual Studio for Mac
